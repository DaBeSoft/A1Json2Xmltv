# A1Json2Xmltv
A1Json2Xmltv gets the EPG data from A1's JSON Interface for its mobile TV-guide apps and creates a [XMLTV](http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page) file.
 
This file can then be imported by various PVR-programs like [Tvheadend](https://github.com/tvheadend/tvheadend) or [MediPortal](http://www.team-mediaportal.de/).

I created this Tool because i think the "A1 Mediabox" is terrible to use and i wanted to use my own infrastructure to watch my A1 TV Streams (which is really not that hard to achieve, there are many guides on the internet). But since A1 TV is IPTV, there are no EPG-data in the Streams. This Tool "fixes" this issue - at least for me :)
